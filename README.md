# Description

  * The purpose of this HW assignment was to design a Portfolio that utilizes Bootstrap and Html to create a responsive and   vibrant website. I made this website only using Bootstrap and HTML. I didn't add a custom CSS stylesheet as I wanted to only use Bootstrap to style my website. This webite will be updated as I progress throughout the program to fully display my skills and coding techniques.
